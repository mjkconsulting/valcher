<p>Notre Dame's Manti Te'o ranked among the nation's best freshman linebackers in 2009, racking up 63 tackles in 12 games, nine of them starts. And during last Saturday's Blue-Gold Game, he looked like the smoothest and most dominant Fighting Irish player. Te'o afterward spoke with reporters, including Sporting News' Dave Curtis, about the team's spring under new coach Brian Kelly.</p>


<p><b>Question:</b> How would you sum up the progress you guys have made?</p>
<p><b>Manti Te'o:</b> We're making great strides as a team. It's a big step to come in front of all the fans to show what we can do, and it's great to come back into the stadium. But this spring has been a great experience, too, for the coaches and for the players. We grew a lot from it.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> How are you feeling about the new defensive scheme?</p>
<p><b>MT:</b> I'm getting more comfortable as days go by. I still have lot to work on, but I'm feeling better and making more plays.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> You guys kept it pretty vanilla today? What did the defense get out of the scrimmage?</p>
<p><b>MT:</b> We're taught by (new defensive coordinator) Bob Diaco that it's not about the call, it's what you do with the call. We knew we all had to get to the ball, and when we get to the ball, everybody has to rally. So it didn't really matter to us.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> What will the defense look like when you guys aren't limited?</p>
<p><b>MT:</b> Well, I guess you'll have to wait until fall. We have a great defense, and everybody's heard the defense is pretty nasty. But all the fans will have to wait until fall to see how we go.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Are you guys faster, better tacklers? How do you see differences?</p>
<p><b>MT:</b> Everybody gets to the ball, and of course, through our conditioning and weight training with coach (Paul) Longo, we are faster and we are stronger and we can last longer. We have whole new mentality toward the game.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Coach Kelly keeps talking about a process. How long is this process going to take?</p>
<p><b>MT:</b> I'm not sure, but I'm pretty positive that throughout summer training, and that process, we'll be getting pretty close to our goal. I don't think you can put a time limit on it.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> What's expected of you this year?</p>
<p><b>MT:</b> I'm not sure what's expected, but I expect a lot from myself. To be a leader for my team and motivate my teammates, and to try to be the best defensive player I can.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Do you feel like this year's defense has better chemistry than last year's?</p>
<p><b>MT:</b> I wouldn't say this year was better, but we get along a lot more. There's a whole new philosophy and a whole new environment, and we're all buying into it. So I would say, yeah, maybe it is a little bit better.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> What's been the greatest challenge in adapting to a new staff?</p>
<p><b>MT:</b> Just not being complacent. There are going to be some bumps in the road and some obstacles you have to overcome. But you can't stop there.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> What's it like going against No. 9 (Notre Dame tight end Kyle Rudolph)?</p>
<p><b>MT:</b> Everybody knows about Kyle. He's a good athlete, and one of, if not the top tight end in his class. It's a great opportunity for me to go against the best. I wouldn't want it any other way. He prepares me the most for a game situation.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> What did you make about coach Kelly's comments about you, where he talked about your potential?</p>
<p><b>MT:</b> Just being coach&mdash;he always wants the best for players. I understood I wasn't at the level I wanted to be at last year. I was young. He knew that, I knew that, and for him to expect the best out of me, it just shows what kind of head coach he is.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> What are your observations of Kelly?</p>
<p><b>MT:</b> I'm just glad coach Kelly runs this fast-paced offense. No other offense will be as fast-paced as us. He's a great head coach, a lot of experience. He expects the best out of us and does whatever he can to get the best out of us.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> How would you describe his style?</p>
<p><b>MT:</b> He's always with the team. Right in the huddle. He's always critiquing us after every play. But he still lets us make our mistakes and try to learn from them. He's in the middle of all of us.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> How would you describe your relationship with your dad?</p>
<p><b>MT:</b> I check in with my dad all the time. He's a great guy and great coach himself. He taught me everything I know. When people are amazed that I can make certain plays on the field, it's because of him. He texts me during halftime of games: &quot;This is what you're doing, this is what you could do.&quot; He still gives me advice so I can be the best player I can be and I can be the tool coach Kelly needs for the defense. I talk to him about mistakes and good plays.</p>

<div class="image_marker_right"><div class="article_body_image_border article_body_image_border_right"><div class="article_body_image"><img src="http://www.sportingnews.com/images/189343/article.jpeg" alt="Jevan Snead went from possible No. 1 overall pick to undrafted in a year." title="Jevan Snead went from possible No. 1 overall pick to undrafted in a year."  /></div><div class="article_body_caption">Jevan Snead went from possible No. 1 overall pick to undrafted in a year.</div></div></div>
First down</h4>
<p><b>Who was the best college player to go undrafted last weekend? </b></p>
<p><b>Curtis:</b> I'm going with Brandon Lang, the defensive end from Troy. The guy originally signed at Georgia before academic issues derailed him, and he found his way to the Trojans. Respected talent evaluator Gil Brandt raved about Lang's performance at his pro day in March, and given the constant search for pass rushers, it's hard to figure out why nobody gambled on Lang in the seventh round. He's not huge at a listed 266 pounds, and he might struggle against the run. And teams likely held a 2007 torn ACL against him. Watch for Lang to stick with the San Diego Chargers, who signed him after the draft.</p>
<p><b>Hayes:</b> The harsh reality of the draft can be brutal, leaving terrific college players scrambling to sign free-agent contracts or get an invite to a camp. Among the lost this time around: Baylor LB Joe Pawelek, Auburn DE Antonio Coleman and Oklahoma RB Chris Brown.</p>
<p>You could build an offensive line of former All-Americans who went undrafted: USC's Jeff Byers, Virginia Tech's Sergio Render, LSU's Ciron Black, Texas' Adam Ulatoski, Texas Tech's Brandon Carter.</p>
<p>But the best player who wasn't drafted had to be Ole Miss QB Jevan Snead. Some scouts believed Snead, coming off a big 2008 season, could have developed into the No. 1 overall pick. That's how far he fell with a disastrous 2009 season that included as many touchdowns (20) as interceptions.</p>
<h4>Second down</h4>
<p><b>The NCAA named Mark Emmert president. What does that mean for college football? </b></p>
<p><b>Curtis:</b> Not much, to be honest. Sure, Emmert has spoken about the inevitability of a bracketed playoff, and in a Tuesday teleconference, he hinted at reform to slow the continuing growth of costs for athletic departments (i.e. coaches' salaries). But the former Washington president's influence won't revolutionize the game.</p>
<p>No academic reforms or spending guidelines will prevent coaches like Nick Saban, Mack Brown and dozens after them from raking in millions of dollars each year. If there's major change, it will be driven by conference expansion and television dollars, not Emmert's agenda as he takes over the NCAA.</p>
<p><b>Hayes:</b> Terrific move. Emmert is probably the most hands-on president in the nation when it comes to running and investing (monetarily and emotionally) in sports programs. He understands the value of the product and the paramount importance of perception and image.</p>
<p>Whether you admit it or not, society too often is based on perception. Let's say a university is contemplating giving a scholarship to a high school player who has 11 prior arrests as a minor (see: Willie Williams, Miami). While the NCAA can't prevent a member university from doing so, I wouldn't be shocked if Emmert picked up the phone and offered his <i>opinion</i> -- if you know what I mean.</p>

Third down</h4>
<p><b>Whose spring game are you most curious to see this weekend? </b></p>
<p><b>Curtis:</b> &quot;WE WANT LOCKER!&quot; (Clap, clap, clap-clap-clap.) Enough with the hype about the sure-thing first pick of the 2011 NFL draft. Let's get a preview of how Washington superstar quarterback Jake Locker has improved over the offseason. Has he grown more comfortable with his drops and mechanics? Will there be signs hinting at an improved completion percentage?</p>
<p>Word is this guy could become UW's most promising quarterback since Warren Moon (sorry, all the Tuiasosopo fans out there). It's time for a clue to see if Locker can match the buzz.</p>
<p><b>Hayes:</b> Oregon. Maybe the biggest spring game of them all. The Ducks have a ready-made Pac-10 championship team and just need efficient play at quarterback to get it done. Anything more than that, and it could be a huge season in Eugene.</p>
<p>Nate Costa and Darron Thomas have been competing for the starting job vacated by suspended star Jeremiah Masoli. Costa has the edge right now, if for no other reasons than his management of the huddle and decision-making. Thomas is more of a run threat than Costa and probably is a better fit for the offense, but he still holds on to the ball too long and takes too many sacks.</p>
<h4>Fourth down</h4>
<p><b>The NCAA's new taunting rule: good or bad for college football? </b></p>
<p><b>Curtis:</b> Good. I'm all for initiatives that seek to promote better sportsmanship, even if this one doesn't begin until 2011. The rule, by the way, essentially says if a player starts taunting before he reaches the end zone, the ensuing penalty would disallow the points.</p>
<p>Two thoughts here: First, don't expect the rule to pop up often. Coaches will hammer this into their players' brains next spring and through camp in August 2011. Second, unsportsmanlike conduct fouls are clearly enumerated in the NCAA rulebook. In other words, players know what they can't do, and officials know what must be called.</p>
<p>We've trusted refs for decades, in all sports, to judge and penalize players' behavior and intent as well as their actions. Tweaking the consequences (in 2010, taunting fouls will be dead-ball and post-play) shouldn't change how the officials view what unfolds. Hopefully, it will change the mindset of some players.</p>
<p><b>Hayes:</b> Good. I've heard all the arguments against it: that it would cost a team points and could change the momentum of a game and is asking too much of young men in the heat of competition.</p>
<p>But in the end, it's all about discipline and structure. What in the world could be wrong with that? Besides, players have plenty of time to get their Diddy on at the next level.</p>

</p>
<p>A week ago, everyone knew that at least one quarterback would be picked in the first round of the 2010 NFL draft.  Most thought that as many as four could be selected on the opening night of the league's new prime-time format.  In the end, only two made it into round one, with another landing in the second round and the last making it into the back half of round three.</p>
<p>Draft position, however, dictates only the amount of money a player will be paid to start his career.  It says nothing about whether and to what extent he'll be successful.</p>
<p>So let's take a look at the chances each of the four top quarterbacks -- Sam Bradford, Tim Tebow, Jimmy Clausen and Colt McCoy -- has to thrive with their new NFL teams.</p>
<p><b>1. Sam Bradford, Rams.</b></p>
<p>The good news?  The first overall pick will get a contract including more than $50 million in guaranteed money.  The bad news?  Well, when you're getting $50 million in guaranteed money, there's really no bad news, is there?</p>
<p>Well, maybe there is.  Of all positions on a football field, quarterback depends the most on those around him -- offensive linemen, running backs, receivers, coaches, front-office personnel.  Even the best physical specimen won't last long in the NFL if he's constantly getting tossed around by defensive players who blast through a porous wall of blockers; or if a subpar running game or coaching inadequacies routinely force the quarterback into third down and long yardage; or if an overall bad team falls behind more often than not, allowing defensive linemen to &quot;pin their ears back&quot; as they try to rip the quarterback's head from his torso.</p>
<p>The Rams need plenty of help to turn Bradford into a great quarterback.  Apart from Pro Bowl-caliber running back Steven Jackson, they don't have much to help Bradford thrive.  Or, for that matter, to keep his body in one uninterrupted piece.</p>
<p><b>2. Tim Tebow, Broncos.</b></p>
<p>The Broncos made the boldest move of the 2010 draft by trading back into round one only three picks after selecting receiver Demaryius Thomas and snagging Tim Tebow.  On one hand, Tebow will have plenty of time to develop into an NFL quarterback under the tutelage of a proven head coach.  On the other hand, the pressure will be intense.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/article/2010-04-22/mcdaniels-stakes-job-on-tebow-becoming-success-nfl">fate of Josh McDaniels</a> and, over the next five or ten years, the well-being of the franchise, rests on Tebow's ability to become a legitimate NFL quarterback.</p>
<p>Perhaps Tebow relishes the challenge.  Perhaps he'll be paralyzed by the expectations.  Either way, his round-one pedigree will keep him in the limelight for at least the next several years, for better or for worse.</p>
<p><b>3. Jimmy Clausen, Panthers.</b></p>
<p>The Panthers' decision to pick quarterback Jimmy Clausen in round two prompted <a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/article/2010-04-23/clausen-falls-down-draft-board-finds-himself-favorable-situation-carolina">immediate praise in many circles</a>. Closer examination suggests potential trouble.

<p>Coach John Fox occupies one of the hottest seats in the NFL as he enters the final year of a contract with no extension in sight.  A coach on the hot seat doesn't need a rookie quarterback; a coach on the hot seat needs players who can help him save his job.</p>
<p>If the Panthers fail to do enough in 2010 to extend Fox's stay, the next head coach may want no part of Clausen.  The new coach may prefer sixth-round rookie Tony Pike, or presumed starter Matt Moore, who now has to be wondering whether he'll have the job come September.</p>
<p>For Clausen, his career ultimately could fade into the same kind of fog that has enveloped the NFL fortunes of Brady Quinn, his predecessor in South Bend.</p>
<p><b>4. Colt McCoy, Browns.</b></p>
<p>Of the top four quarterbacks taken in the 2010 draft, McCoy could be in the best position to succeed.</p>
<p><a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/"><img align="left" src="http://i.tsn.com/i/photos/20090828/122622.jpg" alt="" style="margin: 6px;" /></a></p>
<p>His relatively low draft status will allow him to develop without the burden of expectations or timetables.  His affiliation with Browns president Mike Holmgren will give him direct access to the man who harnessed and honed the talents of Brett Favre.</p>
<p>With the Browns quietly but effectively improving the quality of the roster, McCoy may end up with the kind of supporting cast that will allow him to become, within the next four years, better than Bradford, Tebow and Clausen.</p>
<p>As always, time will tell.  And history tells us that, just as two of the four players ended up in round one, two of the four quarterbacks will end up not becoming successful players at the NFL level.</p>

Matt Hayes' top 10</h4>
<p><b>1. Virginia Tech. </b>A quick qualifier: This ranking applies to Thursday-night games in Blacksburg. The frenzied, Metallica-juiced crowd has the Hokies pumped from the first snap.</p>
<p><b>2. Oregon. </b>The configuration of the bowls at Autzen leaves fans&mdash;in some spots&mdash;less than 10 feet from the field. Sweet.</p>
<p><b>3. Florida. </b>Before Urban Meyer brought defending The Swamp to another level&mdash;and after Ron Zook nearly destroyed it&mdash;Steve Spurrier invented it.</p>
<p><b>4. LSU. </b>Again, a disclaimer: Tiger Stadium at night. Day games in Baton Rouge aren't nearly as scary.</p>
<p><b>5. Ohio State. </b>It's loud, it's wild, and, frankly, Ohio State fans scare me. In a good way.</p>
<p><b>6. Boise State. </b>There's a reason most BCS heavyweights don't want to play in Boise&mdash;and it has nothing to do with the blue turf.</p>
<p><b>7. Oklahoma. </b>The legendary stadium oozes history and an overload of decibels.</p>
<p><b>8. Texas. </b>Recent renovations make it a shrine. Mack Brown's recruiting makes it a snake pit</p>
<p><b>9. Nebraska. </b>Bo Pelini has righted the ship, and the most knowledgeable fans in the game haven't changed.</p>

Dave Curtis' top 10</h4>
<p><b>1. Texas Tech. </b>Neither the biggest nor the loudest, Jones Stadium and its crowd helped the Raiders pull off recent upsets of Texas and Oklahoma.</p>
<p><b>2. Oklahoma. </b>Even when the team isn't championship-caliber, the Sooners thrive at Owen Field. All five of last year's losses came away from home. Too bad Texas never comes to town.</p>
<p><b>3. Colorado. </b>Colorado has gone 4-22 in road games since the start of 2005. But the Buffs have gone 17-13 at home, with wins over West Virginia and Oklahoma.</p>
<p><b>4. Alabama. </b>This one's personal. On my lone visit here, for the Florida game in 2005, an NCAA all-star team wouldn't have beaten the Tide.</p>
<p><b>5. Boise State. </b>These guys win everywhere, including 55 in a row in the regular season on the blue turf. Only five of the wins have come by fewer than 10 points.</p>
<p><b>6. Wisconsin. </b>My first thought about this place was the near-loss to Cal Poly in 2008. But the Badgers persevered to grab one of 30 home wins since 2005. Jump around about that.</p>
<p><b>7. Florida. </b>With Steve Spurrier and Urban Meyer involved, the Gators are a list fixture. With Ron Zook? Not so much.</p>
<p><b>8. Iowa. </b>Incredible fan following especially helped in 2008 win over Penn State. Hawkeyes also seem to get Saturday wind and cold if they need an extra edge.</p>
<p><b>9. California. </b>Better than Autzen? The Bears, sub-.500 on the road over the last five seasons, are 26-6 in home games.</p>
<p><b>10. Troy. </b>Ask Oklahoma State or Missouri about rolling into Movie Gallery Stadium as a heavy favorite.</p>

Here's what the top 25 prospects need to improve on this fall to increase their draft stock (asterisk denotes a rising junior).</p>
<h4>
<div class="image_marker_right"><div class="article_body_image_border article_body_image_border_right"><div class="article_body_image"><img src="http://www.sportingnews.com/images/189074/article.jpeg" alt="A better completion percentage could cause Ryan Mallet&#039;s stock to rise even more." title="A better completion percentage could cause Ryan Mallet&#039;s stock to rise even more."  /></div><div class="article_body_caption">A better completion percentage could cause Ryan Mallet's stock to rise even more.</div></div></div>
Quarterback</h4>
<p><b>Ryan Mallett, Arkansas*: </b>I really believe much of Mallett's accuracy problems&mdash;he completed just 55.8 percent of his passes last year&mdash;are maturity based. The more games he plays, the more defenses he sees, the more decisions he makes, the sharper he becomes. Imagine that from a guy who had a TD-to-INT ratio of 30-7 last year.</p>
<p><b>Jake Locker, Washington: </b>Every scout is in love with Locker, but if he puts up another sub-60 percent completion season, he will be dissected almost as much as Tim Tebow was. Don't know that I've ever seen a quarterback this unfinished with so little criticism from scouts.</p>
<h4>Running back</h4>
<p><b>Mark Ingram, Alabama*: </b>Doesn't have top-end speed, but then again, neither did Emmitt Smith. The more carries TB Trent Richardson gets this fall, the more obvious it will become that Richardson is the Tide's best back.</p>
<p><b>Daniel Thomas, Kansas State: </b>Great size and 4.5 40 speed&mdash;and better than average hands. But he has to show he can be more of a force in games that matter. His only 100-yard games in Big 12 play came against Colorado and Kansas&mdash;two of the league's worst defenses in 2010.</p>
<h4>Wide receiver</h4>
<p><b>A.J. Green, Georgia*: </b>Development was hurt last year by poor play from the quarterback position, and there will be more uncertainty at that position this fall. Clearly has the best skill set of any receiver in the game&mdash;in 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p><b>Michael Floyd, Notre Dame*: </b>Not a speed guy like Green, but has plenty of juice, and the NFL will love his frame, ability to shield defenders and adjustments with the ball in the air. Has to show he can catch tough balls over the middle.</p>
<p><b>Ryan Broyles, Oklahoma*: </b>Does everything well but needs to show he can take over a game. Can he be a guy defenses have to game-plan against, have to double-team?</p>
<h4>Offensive line</h4>
<p><b>Anthony Castonzo, Boston College: </b>The best lineman in the game&mdash;and the most complete left tackle. Needs to add bulk this offseason but has more than enough upper-body strength.</p>
<p><b>Rodney Hudson, Florida State: </b>His technique is terrific, but he needs to be more of a mauler.</p>
<p><b>Jason Pinkston, Pitt: </b>Good size/frame for an NFL tackle, but lacks concentration at times. Athletic skill set a plus.</p>
<p><b>Mike Pouncey, Florida: </b>Twin brother Maurkice paved the way in this draft, and Mike also will be a first-round pick if he has a seamless transition to the center spot.</p>

Defensive tackle</h4>
<p><b>Marcell Dareus, Alabama*: </b>He's playing end this fall, but at 300 pounds, he's a true tackle. His stock will soar&mdash;top five&mdash;if he shows consistent pass-rush skills.</p>
<p><b>Jared Crick, Nebraska*: </b>Can be as dominant as Ndamukong Suh at times but needs to show he can be a consistent interior run stuffer without Suh by his side.</p>
<p><b>Cameron Heyward, Ohio State: </b>Can play end or tackle, but for the sake of draft argument, we'll put him on the interior. A disruptive pass rusher, he needs to strengthen his run-stuffing resume.</p>
<p><b>Marvin Austin, North Carolina: </b>On athletic talent alone, should be the No. 1 interior lineman in the draft. Has to play with more consistency and nasty desire. The reality: DE Robert Quinn is the best lineman at UNC&mdash;not Austin.</p>
<h4>Defensive end</h4>
<p><b>Adrian Clayborn, Iowa: </b>Probably would've been a top-15 pick had he left after last season. Rare that you see an end who is as dominant against the run as the pass. The only issue: doing it every game.</p>
<p><b>Allen Bailey, Miami: </b>Injury and position change have stunted his growth&mdash;and so has the muscle weight he continues to add. The big question: inside or outside? He might be better suited to inside at the next level.</p>
<p><b>Robert Quinn, North Carolina*: </b>Look at these huge (and key) numbers: 11 sacks, 19 tackles for loss, six forced fumbles. That's domination. Needs to show he can anchor at end and stop the run.</p>
<h4>Linebacker</h4>
<p><b>Bruce Carter, North Carolina: </b>Speed, speed and more speed. But can he use it wisely? Overruns plays at times and needs to prove he can take on lead blockers and still make plays.</p>
<p><b>Greg Jones, Michigan State: </b>He's not the fastest linebacker, but he's fast enough and a true football guy&mdash;much like Brandon Spikes of Florida. Needs to improve pass drops and coverage.</p>
<p><b>Von Miller, Texas A&amp;M: </b>Strictly a rush end, and the best in the game last season. He'll play outside linebacker in a 3-4 defense in the NFL and must show he can drop and cover. That, or gain 35 pounds to become a true rush end.</p>

Cornerback</h4>
<p><b>Patrick Peterson, LSU*: </b>Might be the best player in the game this fall. Sleek skill set and an NFL frame to match. Must prove he can stay healthy for an entire season.</p>
<p><b>Prince Amukamara, Nebraska: </b>He and Miami's Brandon Harris should go back and forth all season for the No. 2 corner behind Peterson. Physical in man but needs to show better off-man cover skills.</p>
<h4>Safety</h4>
<p><b>Deunta Williams, North Carolina: </b>The back end of UNC's physical, athletic defense. Terrific ball skills (6 INT, 8 passes defended), but has to show he can stick his nose in a pile and tackle. No way a safety should have only 47 tackles</p>
<p><b>Will Hill, Florida*: </b>Shared time the last two seasons with Major Wright and Ahmad Black but is clearly Florida's best safety. Big hitter must show better reaction in coverage. Gaining that skill, though, could be as simple as getting more repetitions.</p>

Today's host, new coach Brian Kelly, will be along in a second. But first, a bit of background.</p>
<p>Every few years, Notre Dame football slumps to Faustian levels and prompts school leadership to give the program a makeover. The goal is to win national championships and graduate NFL draft picks/Nobel Prize candidates (though these days, beating Navy and USC would suffice). The approach, hopefully, is different than the last waste of millions that ran the show.</p>
<div class="image_marker_right"><div class="article_body_image_border article_body_image_border_right"><div class="article_body_image"><img src="http://www.sportingnews.com/images/188852/article.jpeg" alt="Cierre Woods ran for 110 yards against a vanilla defense in Notre Dame&#039;s spring game." title="Cierre Woods ran for 110 yards against a vanilla defense in Notre Dame&#039;s spring game."  /></div><div class="article_body_caption">Cierre Woods ran for 110 yards against a vanilla defense in Notre Dame's spring game.</div></div></div>
<p>Parts of that approach were on display during Notre Dame's Blue-Gold Game on Saturday. Fans got treated to Kelly's snap-it-now spread offense that offered a reverse on the scrimmage's first play and featured more shovel passes than deep balls. Players raved about better conditioning, some of which came during 5 a.m. workouts. Potential future stars, from running back Cierre Wood to linebacker Manti Te'o, owned the afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;This,&quot; Kelly said afterward, &quot;is just the first coat of paint.&quot;</p>
<p>All the new is real nice now, as it is just about everywhere in the spring outside Ann Arbor, Mich. But Kelly's comments, while praising the work so far, hint at the truth here &mdash; Notre Dame needs victories in the fall, not the spring. April praise, like the first coat of paint, means nothing without appropriate follow-up.</p>
<p>Kelly has experienced just one losing season in 19 years as a head coach, and that gives him the right to keep painting. And although it's important to temper all things spring, the players conceded there's something different, and better, going on here than under previous staffs. Kelly, it seems, has scored early with his sizzle.</p>
<p>The Irish locker room walls feature a program covenant and a creed &mdash; the latter reportedly reads, &quot;The pride and tradition of Notre Dame football will not be left to the weak, timid, or non-committed.&quot; Kelly also brings a coach's charisma, with enough bark to scare his players and enough one-liners to work primetime at The Laugh Factory.</p>
<p>So far, so good, say Kelly's players. The new coach at least has energized his guys, who for a third straight offseason walked around campus embarrassed by the squad's performance.</p>
<p>&quot;Eyes are always on you,&quot; offensive lineman Zack Martin said. &quot;Everyone is coming and asking, 'How does the team look?' We can tell them we're looking good.&quot;</p>
<p>Saturday's efforts didn't showcase warts &mdash; Kelly said his defense stayed vanilla in scheme to allow for some offensive production. Walk-on Nate Montana, Joe's son, threw for 223 yards and three touchdowns. Anticipated starter Dayne Crist passed for 172 yards and two touchdowns. Wood rushed for 110 yards.</p>
<p>But questions remain all over the field for a team that has gone 16-23 in its last three-plus seasons and 3-10 over the past three Novembers.</p>
<p>Consistent receivers need to emerge around Michael Floyd and tight end Kyle Rudolph, both potential All-Americans. The defensive linemen must grow stouter against the run; the defensive backs must play better against the pass. Don't get us started on special teams &mdash; kickers David Ruffer and Nick Tausch both missed extra points Saturday.</p>
<p>The next public view of this Irish revitalization comes Sept. 4 when Purdue visits to open the season. At the four-and-a-half-month pole, it's almost certain the Kelly era won't enjoy the immediate success of Charlie Weis or Ty Willingham. The longer-term forecast looks better than what those other guys produced.</p>
<p>Now, the revitalization shifts to May recruiting. Check back Labor Day weekend for another episode of this show. Meanwhile, somebody get Kelly a little more paint.</p>

<p>CHICAGO -- Northwestern's <a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/college-football/article/2010-04-22/illinois-meet-northwestern-wrigley?obref=obnetwork">Nov. 20 date with Illinois at Wrigley Field</a> will bring a college football festival to Chicago. But Wildcats officials hope the excitement and the financial benefits continue for more than one afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;We're trying to increase our season tickets, absolutely, to leverage our season tickets,&quot; athletic director Jim Phillips said Friday.</p>
<p>Fans will need to buy Northwestern season tickets for five games at Ryan Field to get the tickets to the Wrigley game. Northwestern has a 31,000-seat allotment for the Illinois matchup, Wrigley's first football contest since a Bears-Packers game in 1970. The field's capacity for football should be around 40,000 fans, Cubs president Crane Kenney said.</p>
<p>As for logistics, the 100-yard playing area will stretch from the third-base line toward right field, and the area will be completely grass, Kenney said. Teams will share a sideline that will cover left and centerfields. Players will dress in locker rooms, though Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald said some of his players might dress on campus in Evanston. The Wildcats also might take an elevated train to the game instead of a chartered bus.</p>

<div class="image_marker_right"><div class="article_body_image_border article_body_image_border_right"><div class="article_body_image"><img src="http://www.sportingnews.com/images/188533/article.jpeg" alt="Trent Williams one of 10 Big 12 players selected on draft&#039;s first day." title="Trent Williams one of 10 Big 12 players selected on draft&#039;s first day."  /></div><div class="article_body_caption">Trent Williams one of 10 Big 12 players selected on draft's first day.</div></div></div>

<p>Five things that made the first-round of the NFL draft compelling:</p>
<p><strong>1. Bradford goes No. 1.</strong> The Rams did what most expected, taking the Oklahoma quarterback with the No. 1 pick, counting on him to help rejuvenate their franchise.</p>
<p>&quot;You dream of hearing your name called on draft day, but to actually have it happen, it's a feeling that really unexplainable,&quot; Bradford said.</p>
<p><b>2. Tebow goes in Round 1.</b>  Broncos coach Josh McDaniels made a likely <a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/article/2010-04-22/mcdaniels-stakes-job-on-tebow-becoming-success-nfl">make-or-break career move in Denver</a>, trading three picks to the Ravens to get the No. 25 pick to select Tebow. Tebow's wait is over, but the debate about him will continue.</p>
<p><b>3. The Big 12 has a big night.</b> Five of the top six picks were from the Big 12, and 10 players from that conference went in the <a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/draft/draft?season=2010">first round</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Great competition, week in and week out,&quot; said defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh of Nebraska, selected No. 2 by the Lions. &quot;It's something you can't take away from that conference.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the Big 12 players taken was offensive tackle Trent Williams of Oklahoma, who went No. 4 to the Redskins.</p>
<p>&quot;Trent Williams is a player we targeted who can play not only the left, but the right side as well, and he played the center position,&quot; Redskins coach Mike Shahanan told reporters. &quot;We thought he'd fit in very well. Hopefully he can come in here and compete right away.&quot;</p>
<p><b>4. More trades.</b> The 49ers traded up to No. 11 to take Rutgers offensive tackle Anthony Davis. The Chargers traded up to No. 12 for Fresno State running back Ryan Mathews. The Eagles traded up to No. 13 for Michigan defensive end Brandon Graham. And the Cowboys traded up to No. 24 for wide receiver Dez Bryant of Oklahoma State.</p>
<p><strong>Iyer: </strong><a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/blog/The_Trenches/entry/view/63660/trading_day_breaking_down_round_1s_moves"><strong>Recapping the Day 1 trades</strong></a><b> </b></p>
<p><b>5. Surprises.</b> The Jaguars took defensive tackle Tyson Alualu (No. 10), a player that many scouts rated as a second-round player. If Alualu does not have an immediate impact, the pick will be second-guessed. Meanwhile, Notre Dame quarterback Jimmy Clausen was not taken in the first round, nor were Texas defensive end Sergio Kindle, Texas quarterback Colt McCoy, Florida defensive end Carlos Dunlap, USC offensive tackle Charles Brown, USC safety Taylor Mays and Notre  Dame wide receiver Golden Tate.</p>

<p>EARTH CITY, Mo. -- Sam Bradford had some extreme ups (winning the Heisman Trophy) and some extreme downs (missing most of the '09 season with a shoulder injury) during his college career. The former Oklahoma quarterback experienced a new high Thursday night when the Rams <a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/article/2010-04-22/bradford-goes-first-rams-nfl-draft">selected him with the No. 1 pick</a> in the NFL Draft. Afterward, he talked to Sporting News' Dennis Dillon and other reporters on a conference call from New York.</p>

<p><b>Q. What was going through your mind when you got that call from (GM) Billy Devaney? <br />
A:</b> You have no idea how excited I am. Just to have the opportunity to come to St. Louis and start my NFL career there is a blessing. I can't wait to get there and get to work.</p>
<p><b>Q. What was it like hearing your named called? <br />
A:</b> It was a dream come true. You grow up and you dream about playing in the NFL, and you dream about going in the first round. It just seems so far-fetched at the time. And then to be up there tonight and actually have it happen, it's just an unbelievable feeling.</p>
<p><b>Q. What did Billy Devaney say when he called you on the phone? <br />
A:</b> He just asked me if I was ready to be a St. Louis Ram, and I told him there was no doubt in my mind that I was.</p>
<p><b>Q. What was it like going through the adversity of missing most of last season? <br />
A:</b> Obviously, last year was tough. It was not something I wanted to go through. But I feel like I made the most of the situation. I learned a lot about myself, how to deal with adversity, how to deal with things that don't go right in your life. I feel like I matured mentally going through that situation, and I think I'll be much more prepared to make this transition after going through an experience like I did last year.</p>
<p><b>Q. The Rams have learned a lot about you over the last four months. What have you learned about them? <br />
A:</b> I love the coaching staff. I love the attitude they have. They're ready to start winning football games. When I was in St. Louis for my visit, it seemed like there was such a good group of guys in the locker room. I really enjoyed meeting them. It seemed like they all had a great attitude. They were working hard. They want to win, and hopefully I can come in and help them do that.</p>
<p><b>Q. Do you feel like you can step in right away? <br />
A:</b> That's tough to say. Obviously, I haven't looked at a playbook. I haven't gone through any practices or anything like that. But I can tell you that I'm going to work as hard as I possibly can to get on the field as soon as possible.</p>
<p><b>Q. A lot of people second-guessed your decision to go back to Oklahoma (in '09). Looking back, can you talk about how things have worked out for you? <br />
A:</b> I definitely heard a lot of criticism about my decision to go back to Oklahoma last year, but with all the information I had, I feel like I made the right decision. Even though I wasn't on the field a lot last year, I was around the game for another year. I was able to mature mentally, I was able to mature physically. And I feel like this year, when I do make that transition to the NFL, I'll be much more prepared than if I had tried to make that transition last year.</p>
<p><b>Q. What are your thoughts about coach Steve Spagnuolo, coordinator Pat Shurmur and quarterbacks coach Dick Curl? <br />
A:</b> I love those guys. I got a chance to spend time with all of them. Most recently, I was with Pat Shurmur and Dick Curl at my workout last Friday. We went through a couple of drills that they do at practice, talked about the things they would do in their offense. It was great, and I feel like those guys are very knowledgeable. You can just tell when you talk to them that they love football and they love coaching. And coach Spags, I got to spend quite a bit of time with him on my visit to St. Louis. I sat down with him for half an hour. I just think he's a great man, a great coach, and I really look forward to playing for him.</p>
<p><b>Q. Sometimes the contract can be out of your hands, but how would you assess the upcoming negotiations, and do you see any circumstance where you wouldn't be at training camp on time? <br />
A:</b> That's totally out of my hands. I'm not worried about that. All I want to do is play football. The contract, that's up to my agent; he's going to handle the business side. And I cannot wait to get on the football field.</p>

<p><b>Q. Can you tell us more about what you know now as a football player and what you learned over the past year when you weren't on the field? <br />
A:</b> When you're not playing, you're really able to look at the game from a different perspective. I feel that was what I was able to do. When you're out there, especially in the no-huddle system we were playing in, things just happen. We get a play call, you make the call, you execute it. You obviously understand what you're doing, but then sometimes, as you look back and watch the tape, you're like, &quot;Did we do that? Why did I do that?&quot; When you're not playing, you don't have to make those split-second decisions, so you're really able to analyze what we were doing as an offense, why we were doing things. You were able to look much more in detail at a defense in a game, see how they were playing, see their adjustments. I just feel like I was able to look at the game in much more detail from the sideline.</p>
<p><b>Q. At what point did you know your shoulder was OK? <br />
A:</b> It was about two weeks before my pro day. We were down in Pensacola (Fla.) throwing, and it was just one of those workouts where I was accurate, my ball was coming out quick, my arm strength felt good. After I went through that workout, I called one of my friends and it was like, &quot;I think I'm back. The arm felt great today. It felt like a normal shoulder.&quot;</p>
<p><b>Q. There has been some talk that you take too many hits. What are your thoughts about your playing style and the physical side of it? <br />
A:</b> I've never heard that, but I've heard that one of my strengths is the ability to stand in the pocket as long as needed and deliver a ball accurately. I feel like I can do that outside the pocket as well. I really haven't heard that, but it's always good if you can eliminate hits and keep yourself healthy.</p>
